# Community_Science_Museum
Community science museum website 

An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. The website should be responsive and easy to use on various devices.

You have been provided media assets as text and images (see link under Resources). It is for you to decide how these will be used in terms of presentation, hierarchy, and design.


Project Description
Based on the first-semester curriculum, the semester project should reflect the student’s creative and technical knowledge and skills. This includes design principles, project management, communication technology, and development with HTML/CSS.

Target Audience & Design: The target audience should be carefully considered, and the proposed design should reflect this. A website prototype should be made using your chosen software (Adobe XD, Figma etc.)

Final Product: A URL and zip file with the final website should be submitted. The site should be tested on a variety of devices before final delivery. The student is responsible for setting up their web host or using Netlify to deploy the site. GitHub repositories should be set to private.

Report: Submit a report discussing the design and technical aspects of the project, as well as how guidelines for WCAG, SEO and content management were handled. A template for this report is provided under ‘Resources’.

The duration of the Semester Project is four weeks (full-time) and eight weeks (part-time).

Community Science Museum 

“Explore together” 

Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science accessible to all. 

Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself. 

The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us. 

We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home). 

Explore 

For kids 

Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. 

You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore. 

We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts. 

During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message. 

For teachers 

As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and inspire them. 

Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through for a visit. 

Researchers 

Are you looking to get involved with our team of researchers and academics? Our museum offers various ways for you to use our resources and contribute towards them. We have online records, laboratory space, and a working relationship with a number of universities around the country. 

Exhibition Spaces 

Cosmology 

Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. 

Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system. 

Evolution 

For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world. 

Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too. 

Biology and Medicine 

From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.  

For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.  

Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it. 

Robotics and AI 

The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot. 

Ecology 

As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet. 

In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future. 

 

Special Events and Exhibitions 

News
